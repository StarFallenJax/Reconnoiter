# Reconnoiter
Reconnoiter is a vanilla+ modpack developed by SpaceManJax with mods by various other people that heavily focuses on exploration. You might stumble apon a bandit's hideout, breathtaking new biomes, or even just a nice place to sit down and relax. You can expect mods like Origins, Terralith 2.0, Better Nether, Repurposed Structures, When Dungeons Arise, and more QOL mods. This modpack is currently under development but it is completely playable in its current state. To download, head to the **releases** section of the github page and download whatever is the latest version, if you need extra help, on that download area, there will be instructions if you are stuck.
