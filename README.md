# Reconnoiter
Reconnoiter is a 1.18.1 vanilla+ modpack put together by SpaceManJax with mods by various other people that heavily focuses on exploration and Quality of Life Changes, with an end game goal sprinkled in. This goal; get off this forsaken planet, full of unimaginable horrors, that you crashlanded on and reach the stars. On your journey, you might stumble apon a bandit's hideout, breathtaking new biomes, or even just a nice place to sit down and relax. You can expect mods like [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric), [Terralith 2.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith/files), [Better Nether](https://github.com/paulevsGitch/BetterNether), [Repurposed Structures](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric), [When Dungeons Arise](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/when-dungeons-arise-fabric), and a lot of QOL mods. This modpack is currently under development but it is completely playable in its current state. To download, head to the [**releases**](https://github.com/SpaceManJax/Reconnoiter/releases) section of the github page and download [the latest version](https://github.com/SpaceManJax/Reconnoiter/releases/latest). If you need extra help, there are instructions on that page. Special thanks to aStick for helping me write this.


It is pronounced "REE-CON-O-TIER". I know that isn't how it's meant to be pronounced. This is just how **I** intended it to be.
