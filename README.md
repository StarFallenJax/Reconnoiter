# Reconnoiter
Reconnoiter is a vanilla+ modpack developed by SpaceManJax with mods by various other people that heavily focuses on exploration. You might stumble apon a bandit's hideout, breathtaking new biomes, or even just a nice place to sit down and relax. You can expect mods like Origins, Terralith 2.0, Better Nether, Repurposed Structures, When Dungeons Arise, and a lot of QOL mods. This modpack is currently under development but it is completely playable in its current state.
